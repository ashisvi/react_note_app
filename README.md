# Notes application made with ReactJS + Vite

![app screenshot](/images/screenshot.png)

This application allows you to create, delete and edit notes. It uses the browser's local storage to save notes. I have also added some colors in note boxes to make the app attractive.

`Note: ` You can contact me if you find something wrong in the code or any suggestions for this app and help me to become a better developer.
